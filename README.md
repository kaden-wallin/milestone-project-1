# **Milestone-Project-1**
The first milestone project in my bootcamp

## Description
This game is a set of four triva games for shows that I have watched dozens of times.

This game is very simple to play, you just need to click on the title of a show you want to play and it'll take you to a quiz and then you just answer the questions. At the end you'll have a submit button and a return hub button, they do exactly what their names would imply.

## Inspiration
My inspiration for the game was otherwise useless knowledge of my favorite shows and old flashgames.

## Demo
Here is a working demo hosted by Github pages
*https://kaden-wallin.github.io/milestone-project-1/*

## Technologies
I used Github and VSCode to build my game. In the *sass_styling* branch, I used Sass as well.

## Technical Info
You should just be able to use *npm i* to install everything needed as the package,json is not in the gitignore file.

## Issues
If trying to use this site on your phone, it will look rather problematic. I still plan to style it for phones but as of now it hasn't happened.
